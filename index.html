                <p>
                    Komouri is Japanese for "bat". He had large ears when he was a baby, and
                    resembled a baby bat. Today, however, he resembles more of a Puma!
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    Komouri was originally part of a litter of five kittens. My sisters had name the
                    other four, and he happened to be the one I had named because he looked like a
                    little bat when he arrived. Initially, they had been brought to us at about two
                    weeks old in a flea infested cardboard box. One year later, he has grown
                    tremendously, and lives in a house full of love. He has two older sisters named
                    Goldie and MeowMeow.
